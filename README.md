\* D_D Academy

Welcome to D_D Academy! This open-source project is designed to establish a comprehensive, community-driven learning platform. It's like Udemy, but specifically tailored for the Developer DAO community.

Our mission is to empower developers by offering a platform where they can exchange and acquire knowledge through high-quality, peer-reviewed video content. We believe in the power of community and the importance of giving back, which is why this project is open-source.

\*\* Main Features
Community-Driven Content: The platform will host a wide range of video courses created by Developer DAO members, covering various topics in software development.
Peer Review System: To ensure the quality of the content, all courses will go through a peer review process before being published.
Interactive Learning: The platform will support interactive coding exercises and quizzes to reinforce learning.
Tech Stack
The project is primarily written in TypeScript, leveraging its static typing features for better maintainability and developer experience. We're also using a variety of modern technologies and frameworks to build a robust, scalable, and user-friendly platform.
